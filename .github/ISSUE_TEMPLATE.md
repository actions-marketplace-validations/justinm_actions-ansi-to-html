### All Submissions:

Do the checklist before filing an issue:

- [ ] Are you using the latest version of anti-to-html-action?
- [ ] Is this something you can **debug and fix**? Send a pull request! Bug fixes and documentation fixes are welcome.
- [ ] Is a color being escaped incorrectly? We use [ansi-to-html](https://github.com/rburns/ansi-to-html) and issues related to color discrepancies should be created there.
- [ ] Have a usage question? Ask your question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com). We use StackOverflow for usage question and GitHub for bugs.


None of the above, create a bug report
------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to add **all the information needed to understand the bug** so that someone can help. If the info is missing we'll add the 'Needs more information' label and close the issue until there is enough information.

- [ ] Provide a **minimal code snippet**
- [ ] Provide a link to a failed workflow, if possible.
